## Round 2

Experiment 1: Introduction to Block Chain

### 1. Story Outline:

<div align="justify"> The experiment demonstrates three main features of block chain namely "OPEN LEADGER" , "DISTRIBUTED LEDGER" & "MINING. It's divided into three parts according to the three features told previously. In first part we are showing how a block chain is created by showing transactions between four nodes or users. And creates a block for each transaction joint by a chain creating a block chain.The second part of the experiment contains the concept of distributed ledger in which we are shown how a valid transaction is distributed among all the other users or nodes which creates a copy of the ledger with every node. And the 3rd part consist of mining where a transaction is made which  is said to be invalid transaction.Then to make the transaction valid all the miners start mining and when a miner has completed the mining the transaction is said to be validated and is added to distributed ledger.

### 2. Story:

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
<h2>Construction of the set-up</h2>

For better visualization, a simulator is provided. Block Chain is always taught in a theoretical manner but there is always a need of some physical significance. Since performing this experiment in real life is not feasible because of privacy issues, a simulation can always act as the best possible alternative. A proper animated environment is given for understanding the procedure.Three user control functions are performed one by one for deeper understanding of the concept.

#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>Understand the concept of blockchain  <br> and how it is applied. | Understand | Identify
2.| User will be able to: <br>Understand what is a open ledger<br>and it's creation | Understand| Describe
3.| User will be able to: <br>apply the concpet of open ledger<br>to create  an open ledger | Apply | Implement
4.| User will be able to: <br>To analyze how mining works in validating <br> an unvalidated transaction by  hashing | Analyze| Examine

Enhance conceptual and logical skill

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

The simulator tab would allow:<br> <br>
<dd>1.	To make transaction from users which will create blocks.<br>
2.	The blocks will further get inked showing the 'chain' of block chain.<br>
3.	There would be a ‘Start’ button which will start the processes in first and last part.<br>
4.	You can also read the instructions on the side for further explanation of what is happening.<br>
5.	Second part is for analyzing distributed ledger.<br>
6.  Third part is showing us how mining works and the process of validation of transaction.

##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

Assessment Questions:<br>
Task 1: Understanding the open Ledger<br>

<dd><b> Which of these statements are true for open ledger:-<br>
a)	Every one has copy of ledger.<br>
b)	Ledger can be viewed by anyone.<br>
c)	Ledger is mutable.<br>
d)	None Of these<br></dd><br></b>
Task 2 : To understand how ledger is distributed among all members to prevent mutability<br><br>
<dd><b>1.Which of the following  is true for distributed ledger.<br>
a)	Everyone has a copy of ledger
<br>
b)	THere is one copy of the ledger
<br>
c)	Ledger is mutable.
<br>
d)	None of these
<br><br></b>
</dd>

Task 3 : To analyze the mining process<br><br>
<dd>
<b> A miner has completed the minning what will be the next step:-<br>
a)	Wait for second miner to complete<br>
b)	Wait for all members to complete<br>
c)	Validate the transaction and add it to the ledger<br>
d)	None of the above <br></b>
</dd>
