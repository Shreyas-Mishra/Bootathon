#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :     <u> Expository and problem based.</u>
###### Assessment Method: <u>Formative Assessment and Summative Assessment</u>

<u> <b>Description: </b> In this experiment you will learn about Block Chain and its relevance in real world: </u>
<br>
 <div align="justify">•	The main objective to develop this lab is to provide an interactive source of learning for the students. The simulation that we provide fulfills our purpose.
<br>
•	The learner will be easily able to understand Cryptograph Sciences.<br>
•	The user will able to understand a relation between user and blocks.<br>
•	With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn Block Chain as they are provided with an interactive simulator. It is beneficial in understanding the basics of Cryptograph Sciences which simply cannot be understood by self-evaluation.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment.
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Recall | To state what is Block Chain. | <div align="justify"> Which of these statements are true for Block Chain mechanism?<br> i. For Block Chain only.<br> ii. For Hashing only.<br> iii. For both<br> iv. None of these
2.| Understand | To understand the theory of Block Chain and make student friendly with special theory of Hashing. | <div align="justify">Which of the following  is true for Block Chain?<br> i. Open Ledger<br>ii. Distributive Ledger <br> iii. Mining<br> iv. All of the above
3.| Apply | Apply Hashing to Decrypt Mines |<div align="justify"> How a block is recieved and how it is accessed?
