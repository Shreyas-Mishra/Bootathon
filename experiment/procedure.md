<h3>How Does Blockchain Technology Work?</h3>
                     In general, blockchain technology has the core characteristics of decentralization, accountability, and security. This technique can improve operational efficiency and save costs significantly. The demand and usage of applications built on blockchain architecture will only evolve. Thus, it makes now the right time to get educated on this topic.
                     A hash is like a fingerprint (long record consisting of some digits and letters). Each block hash is generated with the help of a cryptographic hash algorithm (SHA 256). Consequently, this helps to identify each block in a blockchain structure easily. The moment a block is created, it automatically attaches a hash, while any changes made in a block affect the change of a hash too. Simply stated, hashes help to detect any changes in blocks.
                     The final element within the block is the hash from a previous block. This creates a chain of blocks and is the main element behind blockchain architectureâ€™s security. As an example, block 45 points to block 46. The very first block in a chain is a bit special - all confirmed and validated blocks are derived from the genesis block.
                     In short, the size of the network is important to secure the network.
